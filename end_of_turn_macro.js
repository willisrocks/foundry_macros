Macro Name: end_of_turn.js
Author: Chris Fenton
Description: Ends the current actors turn in a combat encounter. If the user is a gamemaster, it will always
             end the current turn. For players, it will only end the turn when the current actor in the turn order
             is owned by you. Based on the work of reddit user serrag97: https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/j1b8gs/next_turn_shortcut/
